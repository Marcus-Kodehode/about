    <h2>Gaming</h2>
<div class="box2">    
    <p>I enjoy gaming with a burning passion, with my first ever game being Doom and Grand Theft Auto 1, I developed a desire for gaming and found my number 1 hobby.
       During my gaming years I’ve played a lot of different games, from Crash Bandicoot, Age of Empire, Total War,
       Crusader Kings 1, Football Manager 2012, Fallout series <strong>(NOT FALLOUT 76, FUCK THAT)</strong> and Victoria 2 to name a few.</p>
      
    <p>Some games I have owned and played continuously since release like Stellaris, Stranded Deep, Ark Survival Evolved and so on.
        My steam library consists of about 150-200 games so I’m not namedropping everything.
        I enjoy singleplayer games but enjoy multiplayer also with friends or player groups I know from before.</p>

    <h2>Horseback riding</h2>
<div class="box3">
    <p>I have been doing horseback riding for about 6 years, but it’s a while since I last was on horseback. 
       Started with a course to learn to ride when I was 14 years old and quit when I was 15 and started riding on my own. 
       I started I a few competitions in jumping. My highest jump is 1,20 meters and my best placement is 3rd place in junior NM </p>

    <h2>My cat</h2>
<div class="box2">    
    <p>My cat is the most important thing in my life, he has been with me 18 years now and since his birth.
       His name is Siam and is a male, Norwegian forest cat with an M on his forehead. 
       I was also so lucky to have been the owner of the mother, so this cat has much sentimental value and one of my only memories from my early childhood. He is named after the old name of Thailand, Siam. 
       Fun fact it is also Mais backwards in Norwegian. </p>
