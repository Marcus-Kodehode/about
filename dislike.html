    <h2>Games too bad too be loved</h2>
<div class="box2">
    <p>Fallout 76 and Dustborn is the undisputed king in the latest years, but you have strong contenders, like Gollum, King Kong - The Rise of Kong
       and The Walking Dead - Destines that is battling it out in the mud to be the worst games i have ever played. Gollum i even finish and i hated every moment of it.
       Fallout 76 i never even bought after Fallout 4's crashing debute.</p>
</div>    

    <h2>Food that's unedible <strong>(in my opinion)</strong></h2>
<div class="box2">
    <p>I'm not the biggest fan of fish in general, not saying it's bad just not my taste.
    Can't say i enjoy cake, candy or some pastery types either</p>
